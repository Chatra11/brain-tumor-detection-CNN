# Brain Tumor Detection using CNN amd Tkinter for GUI

This repository contains an application for detecting brain tumors through a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Python's Tkinter library. The application aims to provide a user-friendly interface for the detection and analysis of brain images to identify potential tumors.

## Overview

The brain tumor detection application utilizes image processing and machine learning techniques to analyze MRI or CT scan images of the brain. The key components and features of this application include:

- **Tkinter GUI**: The graphical user interface is built using Tkinter, providing an intuitive way for users to interact with the application.
- **Model Upload**: Ability to upload and utilize different trained models for brain tumor detection, offering flexibility in choice and experimentation.
- **Image Upload**: Users can upload MRI or CT scan images of the brain for analysis.
- **Tumor Detection**: Utilizing machine learning or image processing algorithms, the application identifies and highlights potential tumor regions within the images.
- **Result Display**: Detected tumors or regions of interest are displayed back to the user, along with relevant information or statistics.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project can be found on Kaggle: [Brain Tumor Classification MRI](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sartajbhuvaji/brain-tumor-classification-mri).

This dataset contains MRI images categorized into four classes:
- Glioma Tumor
- Meningioma Tumor
- Normal (no tumor)
- Pituitary Tumor

The availability of this dataset allows users to train, validate, or test different machine learning models for brain tumor classification.
